# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the bin/rails db:seed command (or created alongside the database with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#
#   movies = Movie.create([{ name: "Star Wars" }, { name: "Lord of the Rings" }])
# #   Character.create(name: "Luke", movie: movies.first)
# user1 = User.new
# user1.first_name = 'Sally'
# user1.last_name = 'Secret'
# user1.email = 'user1@timepeek.com'
# user1.password = '123456'
# user1.password_confirmation = '123456'
# user1.encrypted_password = '123456'
# user1.save
# # file = File.open('app/assets/images/barca.png')
# # user1.photo.attach(io: file, filename: 'sally.jpg', content_type: 'image/jpg')
